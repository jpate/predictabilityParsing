This is an implementation of CCM and DMV (e.g. [1,2]), with extensions to run on two input streams.
The library is called "predictabilityParsing" because one of the streams will be words, and the
other will be (a quantization of) word duration. The idea is to learn something about syntactic
structure by exploiting predictability effects (e.g. [3]). That is why this library is called
"predictabilityParsing."

There are a few elaborations on these models as well.
